In recent years, the rapid expansion of social media platforms and online communities has not only facilitated greater connectivity and communication but has also revealed a darker side: hate speech and online harassment.

In this project we explored the challenge of detecting hate speech using machine learning, NLP techniques, and LLMs for sentiment analysis.<br>
Our focus was on comparing a Keras neural network model to two advanced Large Language Models (LLMs): **Mistral-7b** and **Llama-2-7b** utilizing libraries such as **Hugging Face ðŸ¤—, PyTorch, TensorFlow**, and others.<br> The objective was to classify text as offensive or non-offensive (a binary classification task), leveraging three distinct datasets.

**Keras NN vs. Mistral-7b vs. Llama-2-7b**
Our approach involved training a Keras neural network on the entire dataset, which comprised 140,218 rows of text collected from various sources, including Wikipedia forums. However, **the LLMs were fine-tuned using only 0.08% of the training data, utilizing LoRa** (Low-Rank Adaptation). Additionally, we explored the performance of the LLMs with **prompt engineering**.

The results offer insights into hate speech detection. Through our exploration, we gained a deeper understanding of the challenges, strengths, and limitations of each model or approach for this specific task.
